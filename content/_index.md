# DeadRobotDev's Website
---

Hey! My name is Fletcher (He/Him). I'm a self-taught (game) developer, serial project starter, and
part-time keyboard hoarder. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

You can expect dev logs, technical articles, and LiveJournal-style updates. I might also share what
games I've been playing or the music I've been listening to.

I **finally** started working on the website in February 2023, thanks to the encouragement of
[Elysia Griffin](https://www.elysiagriffin.com/).
