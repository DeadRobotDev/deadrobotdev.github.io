# DeadRobotDev's Website
---

Hey! My name is Fletcher (He/Him). I'm a self-taught (game) developer trying to finish a game.
Welcome to my corner of the internet.

You can expect a mix of technical content, including dev logs, and occasional updates on my personal
interests, such as gaming and music.

I **finally** started working on the website in February 2023, thanks to the encouragement of
[Elysia Griffin](https://www.elysiagriffin.com/).
